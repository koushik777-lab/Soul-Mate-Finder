Thank you Jeevansathi, I found my soulmate with your help. We were searching for a match all over India and then we found Prateek's profile, he lived in the same city and in the same area which we never knew :) We exchanged numbers through your messaging service and then the families met.
Your site is a very good source and easier way to find a partner. Our marriage was postponed due to lockdown in April and then we got married in Chennai during the Nivar cyclone. It was the best time and we had a toofani wedding :)...
